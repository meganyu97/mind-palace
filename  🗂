i walk in from the rain
leaving evidence that the clouds do indeed mourn
i wrap the city lights, the sounds, 
the smell of the wet concrete 
into a neatly wrapped package
carry it past the others, 
the book store visits
the sunrise kisses
the 3 a.m. chapters i couldn't stop reciting in my head the next day
the thoughts i've kept about him.
i step back and look up at the infinite rows and rows of boxes
looking fondly back at me
even the most painful boxes of my past
i've cared so deepl;y for these boxes over the last 23 years 
and they marvel at the woman they have shaped me into
i walk past my first bike ride, 
my first kiss,
my first true moment of pride,
my first heartbreak
i gently place my box on the shelf 
and look at the empty spaces next to it and smile
because i know i will fill these
with all the beautiful memories of my tomorrows.
